# Wids-Datathon-r
This project is in reference to the datathon held at Wids community meetup at barielly.
#Context
Precision agriculture is a farming management strategy that uses technology to optimize crop production. This includes using tools such as GPS, drones, and sensors to collect data on soil conditions, weather patterns, and crop growth, which can then be analyzed to make decisions about planting, fertilizing, and harvesting. The goal of precision agriculture is to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and improve crop growth.
#Problem Statement:
"Develop a model to identify the most suitable crop to grow in a specific agricultural region using data on weather, soil conditions and crop growth."
#Data fields
N - ratio of Nitrogen content in soil
P - ratio of Phosphorous content in soil
K - ratio of Potassium content in soil
temperature - temperature in degree Celsius
humidity - relative humidity in %
ph - ph value of the soil
rainfall - rainfall in mm
#Output
Created a model using Random Forest Classifier having 99% accuracy.
